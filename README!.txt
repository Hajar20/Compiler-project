The project is divided into three main parts that describes the compilation process :
  
    1st part is lexical analysis that was developed in form of a function, this 
    function is used to check whether the words or commands written in the Program file (file name is 'Programme') 
    belong to the Dictionary file(file name is 'Dictionnaire').

    2nd part is syntax analysis it was also developed in form of a function, in this function it makes it possible 
    to check whether the syntax of the instructions of the Program file are correct or not It receives as a parameter
    a list which contains the instructions of the Program file.

    3rd part is semantic analysis in this function the variables are checked to make sure they have been correctly 
    declared

there are other functions that are used to ensure the proper functioning of these functions.

Explore the code carefully, you'll find comment in each part of my code so you can easily understand how the test
is going.
